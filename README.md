            AND t_member.nickname LIKE /*:nickname*/'%kjim%'
            AND t_member.sex IN /*:sex*/('male', 'female')";

    list($query, $bound) = $template->render(array(
        'feature_id' => array(3845, 295, 1, 637, 221, 357),
        'nickname' => '%keiji%',
        'sex' => array('male', 'female', 'other'),
        ));

    print_r($query);
    #> SELECT * FROM t_member
    #> WHERE TRUE
    #>     AND t_member.feature_id IN (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
    #>     AND t_member.nickname LIKE ?
    #>     AND t_member.sex IN (?, ?, ?)

    print_r($bound);
    #> Array
    #> (
    #>     [0] => 3845
    #>     [1] => 295
